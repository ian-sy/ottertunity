## Ottertunity: Building lasting family connections through meaningful conversations.
This was completed for the second-year Designing for Real People project, completed over 5 weeks in a group of 4. In that time, we developed Ottertunity: a cross-platform (Android and iOS) mobile application for forging family connections.

We employed the agile methodology as well as human-centered design techniques, conducting detailed interviews with a variety of users to guide our direction and sprint/iteration planning. Each of us worked on "thin slices", being responsible for the end-to-end implementation of a feature. We still had lots of collaboration and teamwork, where we discussed how to best implement each feature, analysed user feedback as a group, and made development decisions.

This repository contains most of the source code (private information and Firebase API key removed), as well as our human-centered design portfolio and pitch leaflet.
